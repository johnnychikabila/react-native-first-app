etc. Yes, you need instal the Expo app, but don't worry, it takes almost nothing of your memory. 

!! Unfortunately on iOS you can't access other people's Expo apps by scanning QR code due to Apple app store requirements. !!

p.s. So if you still want to see this simple project through Expo Go, drop me a line and I'll add you to the project members in Expo

On Android everything works without problems.


Thank you for watching.
